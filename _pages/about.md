Welcome to my site!

I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
My research and professional interest are in power system control and operation with an emphasis in electricity markets.
My latest work is related to evaluating the grid impact of electric vehicle charging and distributed energy resources.   
Currently, I am part of a team in the grid optimization competition challenge 3, we are developing large-scale Unit Commitment algorithms in Julia.

I am fortunate to be adviced by prof. [Santiago Grijalva][santiago] and supported by the [Fulbright-Minciencias scholarship][fulbright], 
[Georgia Tech Strategic Institute][gtsi], and [grid optimization competition challenge 3][goc3].
