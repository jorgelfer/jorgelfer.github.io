# I am glad you are here!
This site is intended to share news, knowledge, and general information about my interests. I will use this site to document 
things I find interesting, but hopefully it can help someone else someday.

# Tools
## NeoVim
When I am at home, I like to use [neovim]("https://neovim.io/") to write code and navigate folders. During my masters at [UTP]("https://www.utp.edu.co/"),
I learned how to connect to remote servers using [PuTTY][putty], the computer resources were nice, but we only had access to a remote terminal.
For file exchanges with the server, we used [WinSCP][winscp], modifying files or debugging used to take a long time. 
For processing large datasets, I became used to modifying scripts directly in the remote server and running tests through command line. 
Since [vim]("https://www.vim.org/") is natively available in most terminals, I just learned how to use it (2019). My brain just got wired with vim commands and shortcuts. 


## VScode
For project development, testing, and debugging I use [VScode][vscode]. I really like the out-of-the-box settings from VScode, I am definitely slower
when using it, and the constant mouse usage is anoying, but having all functionalities (highlighting, LSP[^1], and DAP[^2]) for all languages without having 
to configure anything yourself is really nice. Don't get me wrong, when I'm at home and have time, I still like to configure NeoVim and learn what is behind
the scenes. It makes me appreciate VScode more.

# Programming languages 
## Python
By default, I use Python. I am very familiar with it and proficient with numpy, pandas, and gurobipy. I like to code in an object-oriented programming way.

## Julia
Lately, I've been experimenting with Julia. Its philosophy of creating publishable packages since the beginning of the development process makes a lot of sense. 

# This site
For this site I am using the [GitHub pages][gh_pages] service and the static site generator [Jekyll][jekyll]. So far, I really like this combination.
Everything is written in MarkDown format and Jekyll transforms it into the static website.
